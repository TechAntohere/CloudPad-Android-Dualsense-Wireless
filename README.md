# Unofficial fork notice

CloudPad is an unofficial Android-focused fork of the original Pylux project.

I am not the original author or maintainer of Pylux. CloudPad exists to maintain, fix, and experiment with the Android version of the app separately from the official upstream project.

For the official upstream project, please visit:

https://github.com/ForWard-Technologies-LLC/Pylux

Please support the official release. This fork contains Android-specific fixes, UI changes, streaming improvements, and experimental features.

# About this fork

This fork focuses on the Android version of Pylux, including Android handhelds and Android TV-style devices.

Changes in this fork may include:

* Android-specific UI changes
* PSCloud and Remote Play fixes
* Streaming stability improvements
* Bitrate and performance-related changes
* Touch/control improvements
* Experimental features not present in the official upstream build

This fork should not be considered the official Pylux build.

# Releases

[CloudPad Android Releases](https://github.com/Chazq2023/CloudPad-Android/releases)

Some behaviour in this fork may differ from the official upstream version.

# Work in progress / known limitations

Pylux and this Android-focused fork are open-source community projects and should be treated as works in progress. Bugs, crashes, missing features, compatibility issues, streaming issues, and unexpected behaviour may occur.

This fork is provided as-is, with no guarantee that every feature, device, game, account, subscription, or streaming scenario will work correctly.

Cloud streaming / Internet Play typically requires a valid PlayStation account and an active PlayStation Plus tier that includes cloud streaming, such as PlayStation Plus Premium in supported regions. Remote Play from your own console may have different requirements.

Pylux and this Android-focused fork do not guarantee that any specific game, purchased title, subscription title, or catalogue title will be available for cloud streaming. Game availability, streaming support, regional access, subscription requirements, and supported devices are controlled by the relevant platform holder and may change at any time.

Users should check official store listings, subscription catalogues, subscription requirements, and streaming availability before purchasing games or subscriptions. Any purchases made for use with this fork are made at the user’s own risk.
