/**
 * In-stream "Quick Settings" slide-in panel. Opened by pressing back (replacing the old
 * bottom overlay bar entirely). A left-hand tab rail splits the scrollable body into three
 * sections, only one of which is visible at a time: a General tab (Performance Overlay,
 * On-Screen Controls, Touchpad Only, Window Size, Motion, Touch Haptics, Picture-in-Picture),
 * a Controller tab (Remap Controller), and a Session tab whose content depends on the current
 * [StreamSessionType] — Remote Play/Resolution/FPS/Bitrate/Codec, Game Catalog, or Game
 * Library streaming settings, built at construction time since the type never changes during
 * one Activity's lifetime. Disconnect is the power icon pinned bottom-left below the tab rail,
 * always tinted with the app's theme colour regardless of tab. There is no Save button — every
 * control applies immediately: switches write straight to [viewModel]/[preferences] and apply
 * live in the same listener that flips them, the Window Size toggle calls [onDisplayModeChanged]
 * as soon as a button is checked, and remap edits both persist immediately and call
 * [StreamInput.reloadMapping] right away so the live session picks up the new mapping without
 * waiting for anything else.
 *
 * The Session tab's settings are baked into the stream at connect time (video profile / cloud
 * allocation), so they can't take effect live on the current stream by themselves. Unlike every
 * other row in this panel, its rows don't apply — or persist to [preferences] — immediately:
 * edits are held in [pendingRemotePlaySettings]/[pendingCloudSettings] only, so closing the
 * panel or disconnecting without ever tapping Apply leaves Preferences exactly as they were.
 * A pinned Apply button appears at the bottom of the tab's content area as soon as a row differs
 * from whatever the live stream actually last (re)started with, and disappears again if reverted
 * back. Tapping it commits the pending edits to Preferences (see [commitPendingSessionSettings])
 * and kicks off a restart: Remote Play reconnects with a freshly-built video profile — near-instant
 * for a direct-IP LAN console, but for a PSN one it redoes the full holepunch handshake first
 * (same cost as the original connect, since the profile only ever goes out in the same one-time
 * handshake that creates the native session), so it can take just as long. Cloud Play re-runs the
 * Gaikai allocation flow for a brand new session first and only swaps the live one over once that
 * succeeds, so a failed allocation leaves the current stream untouched rather than disconnecting
 * the user. See [StreamViewModel.restartRemotePlaySession] / [StreamViewModel.restartCloudSession]
 * and [updateSessionApplyVisibility].
 *
 * Hosted in its own [Dialog] (a separate window) rather than a View inside
 * activity_stream.xml. It used to share the activity's window with the video SurfaceView,
 * which continuously receives new decoded frames — animating/toggling a plain View there
 * proved unreliable to composite correctly (confirmed via logging: the animation completed
 * with the correct end state, but nothing visibly updated), even after forcing a hardware
 * layer. A separate window is composited above the activity deterministically by the OS,
 * sidestepping that whole class of problem.
